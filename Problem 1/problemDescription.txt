Question:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Answer:
233168

Using (sum-of-multiples 1000) will result in the appropriate atom type containing the value of 233168.
(atom (sum-of-multiples 1000)) => T.
