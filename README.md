# CLISP
Files I have written in Common Lisp v2.49
    
    CHECK SUB-BRANCHES FOR CODE:
    
    The first branch is for David S. Touretzkys' textbook on introducing Common Lisp. I used this textbook 
    as a source of learning CLISP, and trying the coding exercises within it. Currently all chapters with 
    multiple coding exercises are included within the branch repository. If there are any exercises missing
    please feel free to remind me and I will update the files.
    
    The second branch is for Peter Norvigs' textbook on Artificial Intelligence Programming with Common Lisp. I 
    am currently using this textbook to introduce myself to A.I. programming concepts and components in order to 
    become proficient with my understanding of Common Lisp. I am also learning from this book to conceptualize 
    basic/early A.I. development for future projects, and to help lead to a stonger understanding of A.I. to lead
    into my next personal learning assignment.
    
    The third branch is for Project Euler Questions and Answer's which are math based problems that need to be answered by writing 
    programs to solve them. I have choosen to sharpen my Common Lisp skills again to dig into the PAIP branch again as well as Math
    skills in getting into Project Euler questions. You can find out more about Project Euler at https://projecteuler.net.
