# CLISP
Files i have written in Common Lisp v2.49
    
    CHECK SUB-BRANCHES FOR CODE:
    
    The first branch is for David S. Touretzkys' textbook on introducing Common Lisp. I used this textbook 
    as a source of learning CLISP, and trying the coding exercises within it. Currently Chapters 3-9 are 
    included within the repository.
    
    COMING SOON:
    Chapters 10-14 of Touretzkys' CLISP book.
    
    Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies In Common Lisp by: Peter Norvig
