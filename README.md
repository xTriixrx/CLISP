# CLISP
Files I have written in Common Lisp v2.49
    
    CHECK SUB-BRANCHES FOR CODE:
    
    The first branch is for David S. Touretzkys' textbook on introducing Common Lisp. I used this textbook 
    as a source of learning CLISP, and trying the coding exercises within it. Currently Chapters all chapters
    with multiple coding exercises are included within the branch repository. If their are any exercises missing
    please feel free to remind me and I will update the files.
    
    COMING SOON:
    Chapters 4+ of Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies In Common Lisp by: Peter Norvig
